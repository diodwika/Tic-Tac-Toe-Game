# Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Pygame library in Python. The game allows a player to play against the computer, which uses the Minimax algorithm to make strategic moves.

## Features
Play Tic Tac Toe against the computer.
Computer AI uses Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
Graphical interface using Pygame library.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Pygame library

## How to Play
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the main.py file to start the game.
Click on the grid to make your move. The game alternates between player (O) and computer (X).
The game ends when either player wins, loses, or the game ends in a draw.
Press 'R' to restart the game or 'Q' to quit.

## Credits
This project is inspired by tutorials and resources available online for building Tic Tac Toe games and implementing the Minimax algorithm.
